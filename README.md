This was my first time coding a complicated project like this by myself so I had some challenges to overcome, but I feel that I've had a very positive expierience with it as a whole

The problems that I faced in development ultimately led to me toning down my expectations for the project as the glitches that I encountered led to the format of players that I had choosen and a movement speed glitch prevented the AI from acting in a dynamic without breaking the game.
